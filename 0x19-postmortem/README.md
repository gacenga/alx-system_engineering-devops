🚨 Postmortem: The Great GDP Meltdown of 2024 🚨
Issue Summary
Duration: 3 hours and 27 minutes (07:15 AM – 10:42 AM EAT)
Impact: The Jua Economy website’s GDP visualization page went rogue, displaying Kenya's GDP as -$42 billion instead of the usual optimistic trillions. Users experienced a mix of shock, confusion, and a sudden urge to move to Uganda. About 73% of users were affected, with most abandoning the site faster than a matatu leaves the stage.
Root Cause: A rogue comma in a Python script broke the JSON parsing logic, causing incorrect data interpretation. To make things worse, our API calls exceeded the rate limit, making the situation escalate from “Huh?” to “Oh no!” real quick.

Timeline
07:15 AM: Monitoring alert fired: “Kenya’s GDP is negative.” Panic levels rising. 😱
07:17 AM: Initial hypothesis: Monitoring tool drunk?
07:20 AM: Confirmed real. Checked if the finance minister resigned. Negative.
07:30 AM: Assumed API glitch. Restarted API integration service. Results still tragic.
08:00 AM: Began debugging the data-fetching script, suspecting a data type issue.
08:20 AM: Misleading path: Investigated the database for corruption—found nothing but disappointment.
08:30 AM: Found the culprit: a sneaky comma in the Python script’s JSON parsing function.
08:40 AM: Fixed the comma, redeployed the service—still showing negative GDP. Tears were shed.
09:00 AM: Realized API rate limit was exceeded due to multiple retry attempts without caching.
09:15 AM: Increased API rate limit, cleared the cache, prayed a little.
09:30 AM: GDP figures normalized. Users started returning cautiously, like cats after a loud noise.
10:00 AM: Deployed additional error handling for API responses.
10:42 AM: Official announcement: “We’re back! Kenya’s GDP is safe.” 🎉
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause
The primary issue was a syntax error in a Python script responsible for parsing JSON data from an API. A stray comma led to incorrect data extraction, making the GDP plummet into the negatives. Additionally, due to a lack of proper error handling, the API integration service kept retrying the requests, hitting the API rate limit and blocking new data fetches.

Resolution
Code Fix:
Located the rogue comma in the JSON parsing function.
Removed it and tested the script locally with valid API responses.
Error Handling:
Added try-except blocks to handle JSON parsing errors gracefully.
Implemented a check to prevent repeated API calls on failure.
API Management:
Increased API rate limits temporarily to allow new requests.
Implemented caching for API responses to reduce redundant requests.
Data Validation:
Added a sanity check to flag and alert for unusually negative or overly optimistic GDP figures.
Communication:
Issued a public statement clarifying that Kenya’s economy is not, in fact, bankrupt. 😎
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements
Error Handling:
Implement comprehensive try-except blocks for all API calls to prevent uncontrolled retries.
Monitoring:
Create alerts for unusual economic indicators (like negative GDP or inflation above 5000%).
Implement rate limit monitoring to get alerts before we hit the ceiling.
Code Reviews:
Establish a mandatory peer review for scripts interacting with APIs.
Schedule weekly script audits to catch sneaky syntax errors early.
To-Do List
 Patch the Python script to log errors instead of panicking silently.
 Add automated tests for JSON parsing logic to avoid another comma apocalypse.
 Setup alerts for API usage exceeding 80% of the rate limit.
 Implement a backup API source if the primary API goes haywire.
 Conduct a training session titled “Commas Are Not Your Friends” for the dev team.
 Send an apology email to users, explaining that Kenya’s GDP is fine (with a meme for goodwill).
Lessons Learned
Syntax matters: A single comma can ruin a whole economy—at least digitally.
Don’t trust APIs blindly: Validate all incoming data because not everything on the internet is true (except cat videos).
Clear communication: Reassuring users quickly can prevent nationwide panic—or at least some Twitter rants.
